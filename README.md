# RockStarQuestionnaire

This project is a webapplication that allows a user to fill in an enquette.

## How to install and run
Before you can run and use the project a few NuGet packages need to be installed:
 - System.Data.SqlClient 	(4.8.3)

Then you should change the name of the database.
And after that it should be ready to deploy.

## How to use the project
The project is used to fill in an enquette that gets its questions from a Database.
The database that is being used can be changed in the DataBase Class by changing the Connectionstring.

### Current faults in the project
- Gifs are completely random, the giphy api also allows for search terms.
- All the communication with the database are fully written out queries.
